    "# Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the fundementals of using LangChain for prompt engineering. Specifically, we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a prompt from a template\n",
    "- create a LLM\n",
    "- create a chain\n",
    "- look at some specialized chains for few-shot prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "For this  exercise, we are going to focus on a classification task. Namely, the classification of the \"stance\" of a comment towards another comment. The base comment is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "comment = \"The new Dune movie does not really capture the vision laid out by Frank Herbert. It feels like they tried to import too many visual effects that take away from the philosophy of the work.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The replies to the comment that we will classify for their stance toward the comment as \"agree\", \"disagree\", and \"neutral\" are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "replies = [\n",
    "    \"The newer ones fail to live up to the sophistry of the older movies from the 70's.\",\n",
    "    \"Frank Herbert wrote a lot of books.\",\n",
    "    \"I think the new Dune movie better captures the spirit, if not the content, of Frank Herbert's philosophy.\",\n",
    "    \"The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog.\",\n",

    "## Understanding Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 How CoT Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique that breaks down complex reasoning tasks into explicit intermediate steps. Instead of asking the model to directly classify the stance, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage 1 (Reasoning)**: Ask the model to explain WHY a reply has a particular stance toward a comment\n",
    "2. **Stage 2 (Classification)**: Use that reasoning to make the final classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Benefits of CoT Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: By forcing explicit reasoning, models often make better decisions\n",
    "- **Transparency**: We can see the model's reasoning process\n",
    "- **Consistency**: The two-stage process reduces random classification errors\n",
    "- **Debugging**: If classification is wrong, we can examine the reasoning step\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our CoT chain uses `RunnablePassthrough` to:\n",
    "- Pass the original `comment` and `reply` through both stages\n",
    "- Generate `stance_reason` in stage 1\n",
    "- Use all three variables (`comment`, `reply`, `stance_reason`) in stage 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Expected Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "CoT prompting typically shows improvements in:\n",
    "- **Complex cases** where the stance isn't immediately obvious\n",
    "- **Ambiguous replies** that could be interpreted multiple ways\n",
    "- **Consistency** across similar examples"

    "\n",
    "### 🌳 Tree-of-Thought Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-of-Thought prompting represents an advanced reasoning technique that explores multiple solution paths simultaneously, evaluates them systematically, and selects the most coherent approach. Unlike linear reasoning methods, ToT creates a \"tree\" of possible interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Three-Stage Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Create multiple possible interpretations of the same input\n",
    "   - Generate 3 different stance hypotheses (agree, disagree, neutral)\n",
    "   - Each hypothesis includes detailed reasoning\n",
    "   - Explores different aspects and interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Systematic Evaluation**: Score each hypothesis objectively\n",
    "   - Assign numerical scores (1-5) for logical consistency\n",
    "   - Provide justifications for each score\n",
    "   - Compare reasoning quality across hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Path Selection**: Choose the highest-scoring interpretation\n",
    "   - Select hypothesis with strongest logical foundation\n",
    "   - Output final classification based on best reasoning\n",
    "   - Reduces single-path bias and errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Advantages Over Other Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Reasoning Paths | Evaluation | Best For |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Regular** | Single, direct | None | Clear, obvious cases |\n",
    "| **Chain-of-Thought** | Single, detailed | Implicit | Transparent reasoning |\n",
    "| **Tree-of-Thought** | Multiple, evaluated | Explicit scoring | Complex, ambiguous cases |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 When to Use ToT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ambiguous inputs** where multiple interpretations are valid\n",
    "- **High-stakes decisions** requiring thorough analysis\n",
    "- **Complex reasoning** tasks with subtle nuances\n",
    "- **Quality assurance** for critical classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "ToT typically provides:\n",
    "- **Higher accuracy** on difficult cases\n",
    "- **Better handling** of ambiguous language\n",
    "- **More consistent** results across similar examples\n",
    "- **Traceable reasoning** with explicit evaluation criteria"

    "| Step | Process | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Parallel Execution** | Run all four approaches simultaneously | Generate diverse perspectives |\n",
    "| **Consensus Detection** | Identify majority agreement | Find confident classifications |\n",
    "| **Conflict Resolution** | Analyze disagreements intelligently | Handle ambiguous cases |\n",
    "| **Final Decision** | Synthesize into single output | Provide most robust answer |\n",

    "### 🎯 Consensus Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Majority Consensus**: If 3+ methods agree → Select majority stance\n",
    "- **Split Decision**: If 2-2 split → Analyze reasoning quality and context\n",
    "- **No Consensus**: If all different → Weight by method reliability and reasoning strength\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 When Self-Consistency Excels\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-stakes decisions** requiring maximum confidence\n",
    "- **Ambiguous inputs** where single methods might fail\n",
    "- **Quality assurance** for critical classification tasks\n",
    "- **Research applications** where accuracy is paramount\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Expected Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Consistency typically provides:\n",
    "- **Highest accuracy** through ensemble averaging\n",
    "- **Reduced bias** from any single reasoning approach\n",
    "- **Increased confidence** through consensus measurement\n",
    "- **Error detection** when methods disagree significantly\n",

    "### 🏆 Complete Reasoning Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Simple → Complex → Robust\n",
    "Task-only → CoT → Few-Shot → ToT → Self-Consistency\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level builds upon the previous, culminating in Self-Consistency as the most comprehensive approach for stance classification."
