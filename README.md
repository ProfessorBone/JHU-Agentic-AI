# Agentic AI Learning Journey

A comprehensive learning repository for **Agentic AI** concepts, applications, and hands-on projects through the Johns Hopkins University program offered by Great Learning.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and learning materials for the **Agentic AI Certificate Program** from Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering, delivered through Great Learning's educational platform.

### What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act independently and autonomously to achieve goals, making decisions and taking actions without constant human supervision. These systems combine advanced reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities to operate as intelligent agents in complex environments.
