## Tier 0 · Prereqs & Principles

**Concept Capsule:**

Agents are more than chatbots — they are autonomous systems capable of reasoning, memory, and decision-making. Before you build, understand their DNA: structured input/output, reasoning loops, and control policies.

**Learning Objectives**
• Define what makes an AI system "agentic."
• Understand why structure and observability matter.
• Set up a clean development environment for repeatable experiments.

**Core Principles**
1. **Role & Outcome First** — Define who the agent serves and what artifact it must produce (text/JSON/report/action).
2. **Structured I/O** — Treat the agent like an API. Inputs/outputs are schemas, not vibes.
3. **Safety by Design** — Ethical rules, refusal cases, and red-team prompts from day one.
4. **Observability** — Logs, traces, and metrics or it didn't happen.

**Env Setup (minimum)**
• Version control (Git), Python ≥3.10, package manager (uv/pip/poetry), .env secrets, Docker optional.

**Build Lab 0:** Run a simple OpenAI call that returns JSON and validate it locally.

**Reflection Prompt:**

What are the three most critical ingredients for trustworthy AI systems?
⸻

## Tier 1 · Basic Agent (MVP Chat + Single Tool)

**Concept Capsule:**

The simplest agent can already act. It receives structured input, reasons about it, and uses one external tool to complete its goal.

**Learning Objectives**
• Create a prompt template and schema for a narrow-domain agent.
• Integrate one tool (API or function call) with schema validation.
• Implement JSON retry logic for output enforcement.

**Steps**
1. **Define role and goal** (e.g., Expense Assistant).
2. **Design input/output schema** (Pydantic/JSON).
3. **Write system prompt** with rules and tone.
4. **Implement one tool** with strict type validation.
5. **Build ground-truth examples** for testing.
6. **Run inference**, validate JSON, retry once if needed.
7. **Expose as CLI** or FastAPI route.
8. **Log every transaction**.

**Build Lab 1: Expense-Assistant Agent**

Parse expense text into structured JSON using one tool (e.g., calculator or date parser). Validate outputs and log results.

**Reflection Prompt:**

How does schema validation change the reliability of your agent?

**Success Criteria:** Valid JSON ≥95% of runs.
⸻

## Tier 2 · Intermediate Agent (RAG + Tools + Simple Memory)

**Concept Capsule:**

Knowledge transforms a chatbot into an expert. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory allow context persistence and informed reasoning.

**Learning Objectives**
• Build a RAG pipeline with a local vector database.
• Introduce multi-tool usage and episodic memory.
• Implement basic refusal and policy layers.

**Steps**
1. **Define knowledge boundary** and retrieval scope.
2. **Create ingestion pipeline** (chunk → embed → store).
3. **Query via top-k retrieval** and budget context tokens.
4. **Add 2–3 whitelisted tools**.
5. **Introduce simple episodic memory** store.
6. **Add safety/refusal logic**.
7. **Deploy lightweight UI** (Gradio/Streamlit).
8. **Cache frequent responses** and benchmark latency.

**Build Lab 2: Knowledge-RAG Research Bot**

Build a domain-specific assistant that retrieves from embedded docs and summarizes results with citations.

**Reflection Prompt:**

What is the key difference between RAG and long-term memory?

**Success Criteria:** 20% improvement on RAG-dependent accuracy; latency <2.5s p95.
⸻

## Tier 3 · Advanced Agent (Multi-Agent + Planning + Observability)

**Concept Capsule:**

When one mind isn't enough, agents must collaborate. The Planner–Researcher–Critic pattern allows distributed reasoning with reflection and self-correction.

**Learning Objectives**
• Build multi-agent orchestration with defined roles and data exchange.
• Implement reflection and self-critique loops.
• Add observability and tracing for debugging and metrics.

**Steps**
1. **Define Planner, Researcher, Critic roles**.
2. **Use structured message passing** (schemas for inter-agent I/O).
3. **Implement planning** and task decomposition.
4. **Add reflection loop** and correction retries.
5. **Separate RAG** (knowledge) from memory (episodes).
6. **Introduce telemetry** and dashboards.
7. **Set up CI/CD** and staging.

**Build Lab 3: Planner–Researcher–Critic Orchestration**

Implement a three-agent workflow that plans, researches, critiques, and produces a final report.

**Reflection Prompt:**

What failures did you observe during inter-agent message passing, and how could schema validation reduce them?

**Success Criteria:** Multi-step tasks complete with ≤1 critical error per 100 runs.
⸻

## Tier 4 · Kick-Ass Agent (Enterprise-Grade, Self-Improving)

**Concept Capsule:**

The peak of agentic evolution: self-optimizing, policy-driven, and governed by constitutional ethics. These agents learn, adapt, and monitor themselves.

**Learning Objectives**
• Implement a constitutional layer for ethical reasoning and alignment.
• Add policy-driven orchestration and adaptive model routing.
• Introduce cost, safety, and performance governance.

**Steps**
1. **Define and enforce a Constitution** (rules, values, refusals).
2. **Build policy router** for task type and risk level.
3. **Integrate multi-model mesh** with cost controls.
4. **Apply governance** and data contracts.
5. **Add hybrid memory** (vector + graph + key-value).
6. **Enable auto-eval** and active learning.
7. **Implement incident response** and rollback.
8. **Integrate with enterprise systems** (SSO, audit, RBAC).

**Build Lab 4: Constitutional Self-Improving AI**

Deploy an agent with a moral framework, automatic evaluations, and cost tracking. Demonstrate safe self-optimization.

**Reflection Prompt:**

What ethical dilemmas could arise when an AI system governs itself?

**Success Criteria:** Safe, low-cost, continuously improving operation.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Prompt, Schema & Tool Templates

**A1. Compact System Prompt (fill-in)**
```
You are <ROLE>, serving <AUDIENCE>. Your job: <OUTCOME>.
Follow the rules:
1) Output must match schema exactly.
2) Use tools only when needed.
3) Refuse if request is unsafe/out-of-scope; suggest alternatives.
4) Think step-by-step but return only the final JSON.
```

**A2. Output JSON Schema (example)**
```json
{
  "title": "AgentOutput",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ok", "error"]},
    "answer": {"type": "string"},
    "citations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "cost_tokens": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}
  },
  "required": ["status", "answer"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**A3. Tool Signature (example)**
```json
{
  "name": "search_web",
